### ðŸ“© Message #1 from Isabelle (Recruiter)

Hello JÃ©rÃ´me,

I hope youâ€™re doing well. Iâ€™m reaching out regarding your application, as Iâ€™m very interested in your profile and background.

To better understand your expertise, could you clarify a few points? Iâ€™d particularly like to know:

1. What is your main area of expertise in artificial intelligence? Have you worked on specific projects or domains?

2. Regarding ecology, what is your experience or interest in this field? Have you undertaken any actions or research related to sustainability or the environment?

3. Finally, could you explain if and how youâ€™ve built bridges between your AI and ecology skills? Have you developed or used innovative solutions combining both fields?

Thank you in advance for your time and response. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,

Hello Isabelle,

Thank you for your interest in JÃ©rÃ´me FRASSONâ€™s profile.  
Here are clarifications on the points you mentioned:

1. **Main expertise in AI:**  
   JÃ©rÃ´me has strong skills in applied AI, particularly in orchestrating no-code AI workflows (using tools like Make and n8n), and in advanced use of GPT-4, Copilot, and Grok for analyzing semi-structured data. He has also fine-tuned GPT models for specific applications such as real estate diagnostics, agronomy, ecology, and meteorology.

2. **Experience and interest in ecology:**  
   JÃ©rÃ´me has dual expertise in environmental sciences and applied AI, allowing him to perform soil and water diagnostics and promote sustainable practices. He has contributed to agronomic consulting and field ecology projects and has a strong interest in citizen science and ecological sustainability.

3. **Bridges between AI and ecology:**  
   JÃ©rÃ´me has developed several innovative projects combining AI and ecology. For example, he created AI-assisted net primary production (NPP) models for lake ecology, integrating field measurements with physical models and ecological interpretation via GPT-4. These projects show his ability to leverage AI for precise and sustainable ecological diagnostics.
